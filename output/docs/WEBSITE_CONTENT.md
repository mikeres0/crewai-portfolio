## About Section

### Professional Bio (First-Person, Authentic, 377 words)

I’ve always believed that technology is, above all, a tool for solving meaningful problems. My journey into software began at age 13, when I automated my family’s inventory spreadsheets with VBScript, sparking a fascination with the power of code to streamline the real world. That curiosity evolved into a relentless drive for technical mastery, and today, I bring 12 years of hands-on experience as a C# and .NET engineer—designing, building, and leading solutions that make a measurable difference.

After earning my Computer Science degree, I began my career building internal tools for logistics firms—where reliability and efficiency were more than buzzwords; they were business lifelines. I cut my teeth on the early versions of ASP.NET, learning the importance of proper architecture, clean code, and the art of debugging under pressure. As the .NET ecosystem evolved, so did I: embracing Entity Framework, mastering cloud-native architectures on Azure, and driving the adoption of microservices, CQRS, and Domain-Driven Design in high-stakes projects.

My technical journey has always been paired with a passion for collaboration and leadership. I’ve had the privilege of leading cross-functional teams of up to 10 engineers, mentoring junior developers, and aligning technical vision with business goals. Whether architecting a high-throughput API serving 50 million requests per day or optimizing deployment pipelines to cut release times by 70%, I focus on solutions that are robust, maintainable, and poised for growth. My philosophy: elegant code is code that delivers value—securely, scalably, and with empathy for users and teammates alike.

I’m a lifelong learner, constantly experimenting with new frameworks and patterns, contributing to open source, and sharing my insights through talks and technical writing. Outside of the IDE, you’ll find me hiking mountain trails, playing jazz piano, or tinkering with 3D printing—always exploring, always building.

What drives me? The excitement of a complex challenge, the satisfaction of a well-designed system, and the opportunity to help teams and businesses achieve more through technology.

## Technical Deep-Dive

### Architecture Philosophy
- Favor composability and explicit boundaries: microservices, bounded contexts, and clear contract-first APIs.
- Design for failure: circuit-breakers, retries, eventual consistency, chaos engineering.
- Choose the simplest architecture that solves the business need, with evolution in mind.

### Code Quality Principles
- Test-driven development as baseline, high coverage, meaningful integration/E2E tests.
- Code reviews as learning/mentoring tools, not gatekeeping.
- Self-documenting code: expressive naming, clear intent, minimal surprise.
- Invest in automation: linting, static analysis, deployment pipelines.

### Performance Optimization
- Data-driven profiling, not guesswork (BenchmarkDotNet, Application Insights).
- Caching at multiple layers (DB, API, distributed cache) with eviction strategies.
- Async/await for scalable I/O, batching/parallelism for throughput.

### Security Mindset
- Secure by default: input validation, least privilege, regular dependency audits.
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for authentication/authorization.
- Assume breach: defense-in-depth, encrypted secrets, incident response plans.

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling as first-class concern (stateless services, containerization).
- Partitioning/sharding for data at scale.
- Observability: metrics, logs, distributed tracing, real user monitoring.

### Technical Decision-Making Process
- Collaborate with stakeholders: business, product, ops, and security.
- Evaluate trade-offs: cost, speed, maintainability, team expertise.
- Document rationale and alternatives for future reference.
